/* In this project, my goal is to create a program that will encrypt a four digit integer from the user, by
 *first prompting for the input and then subsenquently sending the input to Encryption, where the program will
 * add a value of 7 to it and then divide it by 10. Also, in the same program, the user should be able to reverse
 *this process, by multiplying the number given by 10 and then adding 7.
